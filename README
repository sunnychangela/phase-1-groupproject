// WHAT OUR PROJECT DOES...
// Hidden Gem Vacations is a very early prototype of a website designed to be your ultimate travel companion. 
// Its primary purpose is to provide a platform for users to discover, store, and interact with unique vacation destinations from around the world. 
// If fully realized, users of the application can create personalized profiles and curate their own list of dream getaways, 
// turning their travel aspirations into a digital reality.
// In its current state, users can use it as a digital travel journal of sorts, 
// saving their favorite destinations and creating  itineraries for future trips. 
// This website has the potential to offer a valuable resource for discovering and planning unforgettable travel experiences, 
// turning your hidden gems into memorable adventures.
